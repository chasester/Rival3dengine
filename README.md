# Rival3dengine

If you would like to use this engine for a game, please message me.

There are various licenses attached to this project. We are still in a pre-alpha state. All source code is labeled as MIT and assets are marked by asset. Assets will be replaced by non-commerial free use ones. The code may later change as well to non-commercial free use.

If you would like to collaborate, please message me with one of the projects and create a branch. When done submit the branch and I will review and make changes or add pointers etc.

For this project I want to have a fairly standard code standard, please follow the code standard when submitting code, If you fail to I will probably reject your branch.

I will post the code standard here later.

I will update this better when the project is more substantiated.
